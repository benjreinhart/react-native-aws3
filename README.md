## Note on S3 user permissions

The user associated with the `accessKey` and `secretKey` you use must have the appropriate permissions assigned to them. My user's IAM policy looks like:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1458840156000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectVersionAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/uploads/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Example

```javascript
import { RNS3 } from 'react-native-aws3';

const file = {
  // `uri` can also be a file system path (i.e. file://)
  uri: "assets-library://asset/asset.PNG?id=655DBE66-8008-459C-9358-914E1FB532DD&ext=PNG",
  name: "image.png",
  type: "image/png"
}

const options = {
  keyPrefix: "uploads/",
  bucket: "your-bucket",
  region: "us-east-1",
  accessKey: "your-access-key",
  secretKey: "your-secret-key",
  successActionStatus: 201
}

RNS3.put(file, options).then(response => {
  if (response.status !== 201)
    throw new Error("Failed to upload image to S3");
  console.log(response.body);
  /**
   * {
   *   postResponse: {
   *     bucket: "your-bucket",
   *     etag : "9f620878e06d28774406017480a59fd4",
   *     key: "uploads/image.png",
   *     location: "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2Fimage.png"
   *   }
   * }
   */
});
```

## Usage

### put(file, options)

Upload a file to S3.

Arguments:

1. `file`
  * `uri` **required** - File system URI, can be assets library path or `file://` path
  * `name` **required** - The name of the file, will be stored as such in S3
  * `type` **required** - The mime type, also used for `Content-Type` parameter in the S3 post policy
2. `options`
  * `acl` - The [Access Control List](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) of this object. Defaults to `public-read`
  * `keyPrefix` - Prefix, or path to the file on S3, i.e. `uploads/` (note the trailing slash)
  * `bucket` **required** - Your S3 bucket
  * `region` **required** - The region of your S3 bucket
  * `accessKey` **required** - Your S3 `AWSAccessKeyId`
  * `secretKey` **required** - Your S3 `AWSSecretKey`
  * `successActionStatus` - HTTP response status if successful, defaults to 201
  * `awsUrl` - [AWS S3 url](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region). Defaults to `s3.amazonaws.com`
  * `timeDelta` - Devices time offset from world clock in milliseconds, defaults to 0
  * `sessionToken` - When working w/ Cognito (info below)
  * `successActionStatus` - HTTP response status if successful, defaults to 201.

Returns an object that wraps an `XMLHttpRequest` instance and behaves like a promise, with the following additional methods:

* `progress` - accepts a callback which will be called with an event representing the progress of the upload. Event object is of shape
  * `loaded` - amount uploaded
  * `total` - total amount to upload
  * `percent` - number between 0 and 1 representing the percent completed
* `abort` - aborts the xhr instance

Examples:
```javascript
RNS3.put(file, options)
  .progress((e) => console.log(e.loaded / e.total)); // or console.log(e.percent)

RNS3.put(file, option)
  .abort();
```

## Cognito

[Cognito](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) is a service that enables you to create unique identities for your users. If you are using Cognito, you'll need to pass in the session token you received from AWS Security Token Service as the `sessionToken` key in the `options` hash. See the [Cognito](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) and [temporary security credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html#RequestWithSTS) documentation for more information.

## TODO
